# Navigator Best Practices

Maximize efficiency with these proven patterns.

## Document Structure

### Keep Index Lightweight

```markdown
# Project Index (~500 words max)

## Quick Links
[Link to detailed docs, don't inline content]

## Key Decisions
[Brief summary, details in linked docs]
```

### Use Lazy Loading

```markdown
<!-- Good: Reference, don't inline -->
See [Authentication Flow](system/auth.md) for details.

<!-- Bad: Inline everything -->
## Authentication Flow
[500 lines of documentation...]
```

## Task Documentation

### Before Starting

```bash
/nav-task "Add user authentication"
```

This creates a task plan in `.agent/tasks/` with:
- Requirements analysis
- Implementation steps
- Affected files
- Test plan

### After Completion

Archive the task with learnings:

```bash
/nav-task archive
```

## Knowledge Graph

### Capture Decisions

When making non-obvious choices:

```bash
/nav-graph add decision "Use JWT over sessions for stateless scaling"
```

### Document Pitfalls

When encountering issues:

```bash
/nav-graph add pitfall "GitHub API rate limits during CI - use conditional requests"
```

## Session Management

### Use Markers

Before risky changes:

```bash
/nav-marker "Before auth refactor"
```

### Compact Regularly

After completing tasks:

```bash
/nav-compact
```

This clears context while preserving knowledge in the graph.

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Do Instead |
|-------|------------|
| Load all docs at session start | Use lazy loading |
| Inline large code blocks in docs | Reference file paths |
| Skip task documentation | Always create task plans |
| Ignore knowledge graph | Capture decisions and pitfalls |
| Let context grow unbounded | Compact after each task |
