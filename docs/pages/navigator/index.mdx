# Why Navigator?

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Pilot without Navigator is just another Claude Code wrapper with zero value.
</Callout>

## The Problem

Raw Claude Code sessions have critical limitations:

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Loads entire codebase | ~150k tokens consumed immediately |
| Short sessions | Exhausted after 5-7 exchanges |
| No memory | Repeated explanations every session |
| Context waste | 92% of loaded context unused |

## The Navigator Solution

Navigator provides **context engineering** - loading only what's needed, when it's needed.

| Metric | Without Navigator | With Navigator |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Token usage | ~150,000 | ~12,000 |
| Session length | 5-7 exchanges | 20+ exchanges |
| Context efficiency | 8% | **92%** |
| Knowledge persistence | ❌ None | ✅ Graph-based |

## How Pilot Uses Navigator

When Pilot detects a `.agent/` directory in your project, it automatically:

1. Starts a Navigator session
2. Loads only the index document (~2k tokens)
3. Lazy-loads additional docs as needed
4. Captures decisions in the knowledge graph
5. Preserves context across tasks
