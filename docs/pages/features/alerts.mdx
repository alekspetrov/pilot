# Alerts & Notifications

Pilot's event-driven alert engine monitors task execution, autopilot health, budget consumption, and security events, delivering notifications to Slack, Telegram, email, webhooks, and PagerDuty.

## Overview

The alert engine provides:

- **Event-driven architecture** — Events flow asynchronously through an evaluation pipeline
- **Rule-based evaluation** — Configurable conditions with cooldown enforcement
- **Multi-channel dispatch** — Parallel delivery to Slack, Telegram, email, webhook, PagerDuty
- **Severity filtering** — Route alerts by severity level to appropriate channels

<Callout type="info">
Pilot ships with 17 built-in alert types covering task lifecycle, budget, autopilot health, and security events. All rules are configurable via YAML.
</Callout>

### Event Flow

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌────────────────┐
│  Executor   │────▶│ Engine       │────▶│ Event Channel  │
│  (events)   │     │ Adapter      │     │ (buffered: 100)│
└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └───────┬────────┘
                                                  │

```

1. **Event generation** — The executor emits events for task start, progress, completion, and failure
2. **Adapter conversion** — `EngineAdapter` converts executor events to alert events (avoids import cycles)
3. **Async queue** — Events enter a buffered channel (capacity 100) for non-blocking processing
4. **Rule evaluation** — Engine matches events against enabled rules, checking conditions and cooldowns
5. **Parallel dispatch** — Matching alerts route to configured channels concurrently via goroutines

### Severity Levels

| Level | Use Case | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `info` | Informational, no action required | PR stuck in CI for 15 minutes |
| `warning` | Attention needed, not urgent | Daily spend at 80% of limit |
| `critical` | Immediate action required | Circuit breaker tripped, budget depleted |

## Built-in Events

Pilot monitors 17 event types across five categories. Each event type has a default rule that can be customized or overridden in your configuration.

### Operational Events

These events monitor task execution health and service availability.

| Event Type | Default Severity | Default Cooldown | Description |
|------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| `task_stuck` | warning | 15m | Fires when a task has no progress for the configured duration (default: 10 minutes). Indicates a potentially hung process or blocked operation. |
| `task_failed` | warning | 0 | Fires immediately on any task failure. Zero cooldown ensures every failure is reported. |
| `consecutive_failures` | critical | 30m | Fires when multiple tasks fail in sequence (default: 3). Indicates a systemic issue requiring immediate attention. |
| `service_unhealthy` | critical | 15m | Fires when a core service (executor, autopilot, gateway) fails health checks. |

<Callout type="info">
The `consecutive_failures` counter resets to zero when a task succeeds. This prevents stale failure counts from triggering false alerts after the system recovers.
</Callout>

### Cost/Usage Events

These events monitor budget consumption and spending patterns.

| Event Type | Default Severity | Default Cooldown | Description |
|------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| `daily_spend_exceeded` | warning | 1h | Fires when daily API spend exceeds the configured threshold (default: $50 USD). |
| `budget_depleted` | critical | 4h | Fires when the monthly budget limit is exceeded (default: $500 USD). Requires immediate action to restore operations. |
| `usage_spike` | warning | 1h | Fires when API usage increases by more than the configured percentage (e.g., 200% = 3x normal usage). Helps detect runaway processes or unexpected load. |

<Callout type="warning">
Cost-related rules are **disabled by default**. Enable them in your configuration and set appropriate thresholds for your organization's budget.
</Callout>

### Security Events

These events monitor for suspicious activity and unauthorized access.

| Event Type | Default Severity | Default Cooldown | Description |
|------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| `unauthorized_access` | critical | 0 | Fires on any unauthorized access attempt. Zero cooldown ensures all security events are logged. |
| `sensitive_file_modified` | critical | 0 | Fires when a file matching the configured patterns (e.g., `*.env`, `secrets/**`) is modified. |
| `unusual_pattern` | warning | 15m | Fires when activity matches suspicious patterns (regex-based detection). |

### Autopilot Health Events

These events monitor the autopilot subsystem for operational issues.

| Event Type | Default Severity | Default Cooldown | Description |
|------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| `failed_queue_high` | warning | 30m | Fires when the failed issue queue exceeds the threshold (default: 5 issues). Indicates issues are failing faster than they can be triaged. |
| `circuit_breaker_trip` | critical | 30m | Fires when the autopilot circuit breaker activates due to consecutive failures. Autopilot pauses processing until manually reset or timeout expires. |
| `api_error_rate_high` | warning | 15m | Fires when API error rate exceeds the threshold (default: 10 errors/minute). |
| `pr_stuck_waiting_ci` | info | 15m | Fires when a PR has been in `waiting_ci` state for too long (default: 15 minutes). |

### Advanced Events

These events detect complex failure scenarios and trigger escalation workflows.

| Event Type | Default Severity | Default Cooldown | Description |
|------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| `deadlock` | critical | 1h | Fires when autopilot has no state transitions for the configured duration (default: 1 hour). Indicates the system may be stuck. |
| `escalation` | critical | 1h | Fires after repeated failures for the same source (default: 3 retries). Routes to PagerDuty or on-call channels. |
| `heartbeat_timeout` | critical | 5m | Fires when the executor process misses its heartbeat signal, indicating a crash or hang. |

## Alert Channels

Pilot supports five alert channel types. Each channel can filter alerts by severity level, enabling routing of critical alerts to PagerDuty while sending informational alerts to Slack.

<Callout type="info">
Cost-related rules (`daily_spend`, `budget_depleted`) are disabled by default. Enable them and set appropriate thresholds in your configuration.
</Callout>

### RuleCondition Fields

Rule conditions define when an alert fires. Fields are grouped by category:

**Task-Related Conditions**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `progress_unchanged_for` | duration | Time without progress to trigger stuck alert (e.g., `10m`) |
| `consecutive_failures` | integer | Number of consecutive task failures to trigger alert |

**Cost-Related Conditions**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `daily_spend_threshold` | float | USD amount for daily spend alert |
| `budget_limit` | float | USD amount for budget depletion alert |
| `usage_spike_percent` | float | Percentage increase to trigger spike alert (e.g., `200` = 200%) |

**Pattern Matching Conditions**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `pattern` | string | Regex pattern for matching event content |
| `file_pattern` | string | Glob pattern for file paths (e.g., `*.env`, `secrets/**`) |
| `paths` | string[] | Specific file paths to watch |

**Autopilot Health Conditions**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `failed_queue_threshold` | integer | Maximum failed issues before alert |
| `api_error_rate_per_min` | float | Errors per minute threshold |
| `pr_stuck_timeout` | duration | Maximum time a PR can wait in CI state |

**Advanced Conditions**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `deadlock_timeout` | duration | Time without state transitions to detect deadlock |
| `escalation_retries` | integer | Number of failures before escalating (default: 3) |

## Cooldown Periods

Cooldowns prevent alert fatigue by limiting how often a rule can fire.

### How Cooldowns Work

1. **Per-rule tracking** — Each rule maintains its own last-fired timestamp
2. **Check before firing** — The engine calls `shouldFire()` before dispatching an alert
3. **Zero cooldown** — A cooldown of `0` means fire every time (no rate limiting)
4. **Independent tracking** — Different rules have independent cooldown timers

```
Rule fires at t=0
├── t=5m: New event matches rule → Cooldown active (15m), skip
├── t=10m: New event matches rule → Cooldown active, skip
├── t=15m: New event matches rule → Cooldown expired, fire alert
└── t=16m: New event matches rule → Cooldown active (15m), skip
```

### When to Use Which Cooldown

| Scenario | Recommended Cooldown |
|----------|---------------------|
| Critical failures requiring immediate attention | `0` (fire every time) |
| Task failures (need immediate visibility) | `0` |
| Stuck task detection | `15m` (matches detection threshold) |
| Budget warnings | `1h` (avoid hourly spam) |
| Rate-limit based alerts | Match the detection window |
| Health check alerts | `15-30m` (balance visibility and noise) |
| Escalation alerts | `1h` (give time to resolve) |

### Custom Rules Example

      enabled: true
      condition:
        progress_unchanged_for: 30m
      severity: warning
      channels: [slack-ops]
      cooldown: 30m

          - ".env"
          - ".env.production"
          - "secrets/**"
      severity: critical
      channels: [pagerduty-security, slack-security]
      cooldown: 0
      description: "Environment or secrets file was modified"

    # Custom: Lower API error threshold for production
    - name: api_errors_prod
      type: api_error_rate_high
      enabled: true
      condition:
        api_error_rate_per_min: 5.0
      severity: critical
      channels: [pagerduty-oncall]
      cooldown: 10m
      labels:
        environment: production
      description: "Production API error rate exceeds 5/min"

    # Custom: Escalate after 2 retries instead of 3

      enabled: true
      condition:
        escalation_retries: 2
      severity: critical
      channels: [pagerduty-oncall]
      cooldown: 30m
      description: "Escalate quickly after 2 consecutive failures"
```

<Callout type="warning">
When defining custom rules, ensure the `type` matches one of the 17 built-in event types. Custom rules override defaults only if they share the same `name`.
