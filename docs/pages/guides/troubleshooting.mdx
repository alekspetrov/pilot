# Troubleshooting

Common issues and how to fix them. Start with `pilot doctor` — it catches most configuration problems.

```bash
pilot doctor
```

---

## Installation Issues

### "pilot: command not found"

The binary isn't in your PATH.

```bash
# Check if it's installed
ls ~/.local/bin/pilot

# Add to PATH (add to your shell rc file)
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

If installed via Homebrew, it should be in PATH automatically. Try opening a new terminal.

### "permission denied" when running pilot

```bash
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/pilot
```

On macOS, you may also need to remove the quarantine attribute:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/.local/bin/pilot
```

## Claude Code Issues

### "claude: command not found"

Claude Code isn't installed or isn't in PATH.

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Verify: `claude --version`

### Claude Code authentication errors

If using a Claude subscription:

```bash
claude login
```

If using an API key:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
```

<Callout type="info">
Pilot delegates all AI execution to Claude Code. If `claude -p "hello"` works in your terminal, Pilot will work too.
</Callout>

## Issue Detection

### Pilot doesn't pick up my issue

1. **Check the label** — must be exactly `pilot` (case-sensitive, no spaces)
2. **Check polling is enabled** — verify config:
   ```yaml
   adapters:
     github:  # or gitlab
       polling:
         enabled: true
         interval: 30s
   ```
3. **Check the token** — `GITHUB_TOKEN` must have `repo` scope
4. **Check the repo** — `adapters.github.repo` must match `owner/repo` exactly
5. **Check the project path** — `project_path` must point to a valid local clone

### Issues are picked up but nothing happens

- Check `pilot start` output for errors
- The issue may have been processed before — Pilot adds `pilot-in-progress` label
- Stale `pilot-in-progress` labels block re-processing. Remove them manually or wait for stale cleanup (default: 1 hour)

---

## PR Issues

### PR creation fails

- **GitHub**: Token needs `repo` scope. Check with `gh auth status`
- **GitLab**: Token needs `api`, `read_repository`, `write_repository` scopes
- **Branch conflicts**: If the branch already exists, Pilot may fail to push. Delete stale branches: `git push origin --delete pilot/issue-name`

### PR quality is low

1. **Initialize Navigator** — run `claude /nav-init` inside Claude Code in your project
2. **Add CLAUDE.md** — describe your code standards, patterns, and conventions
3. **Write better tickets** — treat them like briefings for a junior developer. Include context, requirements, and expected behavior
4. **Configure quality gates** — auto-detected or in config. Failed gates get retried with error feedback

---

## Upgrade Issues

### "Homebrew installation detected"

`pilot upgrade` is blocked for Homebrew installs. Use:

```bash
brew upgrade pilot
```

Or switch to self-managed installation:

```bash
brew uninstall pilot
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alekspetrov/pilot/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Upgrade failed / binary corrupted

```bash
pilot upgrade rollback
```

This restores the backup created during the upgrade.

---

## Performance

### Token costs seem high

- **Navigator** reduces token usage by ~92% — make sure `.agent/` is initialized in your project
- **Model routing** — enable to route trivial tasks to Haiku instead of Opus:
  ```yaml
  executor:
    model_routing:
      enabled: true
      trivial: "claude-haiku"
  ```
- **Budget limits** — set daily/monthly caps to prevent runaway spend:
  ```yaml
  budget:
    enabled: true
    daily_limit: 50.00
  ```

### Tasks take too long

- Check `executor.timeout.default` — default is 30 minutes
- Complex tasks may benefit from epic decomposition:
  ```yaml
  executor:
    decompose:
      enabled: true
  ```
- Use the dashboard (`pilot start --dashboard`) to monitor progress in real-time

---

## Dashboard

### Dashboard doesn't show updates

- Make sure you're running with `--dashboard` flag
- Refresh interval is configurable: `dashboard.refresh_interval: 1000` (ms)
- SQLite WAL mode should handle concurrent access — if issues persist, check file permissions on `~/.pilot/data/`

### Dashboard shows "Update available" but won't upgrade

- Press `u` to trigger the upgrade
- If tasks are running, Pilot waits up to 2 minutes for them to complete
- Homebrew installs can't self-upgrade — see Upgrade Issues above

## Getting Help

If none of the above resolves your issue:

1. Check existing issues: [github.com/alekspetrov/pilot/issues](https://github.com/alekspetrov/pilot/issues)
2. Run with debug logging: set `logging.level: "debug"` in config
3. Open a new issue with `pilot doctor` output and relevant logs
