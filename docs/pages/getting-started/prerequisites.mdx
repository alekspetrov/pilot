# Prerequisites

Before installing Pilot, you need two things: **Claude Code** for AI execution and a **Git hosting account** for issue tracking and PRs.

{/* ILLUSTRATION: Prerequisites overview — Claude Code + Git host logos */}

---

## Claude Code

Pilot uses [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) as its execution engine. Claude Code is Anthropic's CLI tool for AI-powered development — Pilot orchestrates it as a subprocess.

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

After installing, authenticate Claude Code using one of two methods:

<Tabs items={['Claude Subscription (recommended)', 'Anthropic API Key']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
### Claude Subscription

If you have a **Claude Pro** ($20/mo) or **Claude Max** ($100–200/mo) subscription, Claude Code authenticates through your subscription. No API key needed.

```bash
# Log in with your Claude account
claude login
```

This is the simplest setup — your subscription covers all Claude Code usage. Pilot invokes Claude Code as a subprocess and inherits your authentication automatically.

<Callout type="info">
Claude Max plans include higher rate limits and longer context windows, which benefit complex tasks. Pro works fine for most use cases.
</Callout>
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
### Anthropic API Key

For pay-per-use pricing or enterprise deployments, set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable. Claude Code picks it up automatically.

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"
```

Get an API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com). Pricing is per-token (input + output) with no monthly commitment.

<Callout type="info">
Pilot also uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` directly for two optional internal features: the LLM intent classifier (Haiku) for smarter Telegram message routing, and structured subtask parsing for epic decomposition. These features gracefully degrade to simpler alternatives when no API key is set.
</Callout>
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Git Hosting

Pilot needs access to a Git repository to poll issues and create pull requests. Both GitHub and GitLab are supported as first-class platforms.

<Tabs items={['GitHub', 'GitLab']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
### GitHub

Create a **Personal Access Token** (classic) at [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with these scopes:

- `repo` — full repository access (issues, PRs, code)
- `workflow` — trigger GitHub Actions (if using CI)

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-github-pat"
```

<Callout type="warning">
Fine-grained tokens work too, but require explicit permissions for each repository. Classic tokens are simpler for getting started.
</Callout>
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
### GitLab

Create a **Personal Access Token** at `Settings → Access Tokens` with these scopes:

- `api` — full API access
- `read_repository` — clone and read code
- `write_repository` — push branches and create MRs

```bash
export GITLAB_TOKEN="your-gitlab-pat"
```

For **self-hosted GitLab**, use a Project Access Token instead for better security isolation. Configure the instance URL in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
adapters:
  gitlab:
    base_url: "https://gitlab.yourcompany.com"
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Optional Integrations

These are not required to get started but extend Pilot's capabilities:

| Integration | What It Does | Setup |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **Telegram** | Chat interface — send tasks, get notifications, approve merges | Create bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather), set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` |
| **Slack** | Notifications for task progress, completions, and failures | Create Slack app, set `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` |
| **Linear** | Poll Linear issues instead of (or alongside) GitHub Issues | Set `LINEAR_API_KEY` |
| **Jira** | Poll Jira issues for task intake | Set `JIRA_API_TOKEN` |

See [Integrations](/integrations/linear) for detailed setup guides.

## Checklist

Before proceeding to [Installation](/getting-started/installation):

- [ ] Claude Code installed (`claude --version` outputs a version)
- [ ] Claude Code authenticated (subscription login or API key set)
- [ ] Git host token created and exported (`GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GITLAB_TOKEN`)
- [ ] Repository exists with at least one commit

<Callout type="info">
Run `pilot doctor` after installation to verify all prerequisites are met. It checks for Claude Code, Git, token configuration, and optional dependencies.
</Callout>
