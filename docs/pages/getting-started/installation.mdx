# Installation

Pilot is a single Go binary. Install it, run `pilot doctor`, and you're ready.

{/* ILLUSTRATION: Installation methods comparison — curl vs brew vs source */}

## Recommended: Quick Install

The install script downloads the latest release for your platform and installs to `~/.local/bin/pilot`.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alekspetrov/pilot/main/install.sh | bash
```

This method supports **hot-upgrade** — Pilot can update itself in-place without manual intervention. When running in daemon mode (`pilot start`), press `u` in the dashboard to upgrade without downtime. See [Hot Upgrade](/features/hot-upgrade) for details.

<Callout type="info">
The script auto-detects your OS (macOS/Linux) and architecture (amd64/arm64). It also adds `~/.local/bin` to your PATH if needed.
</Callout>

## Alternative: Homebrew

```bash
brew tap alekspetrov/pilot
brew install pilot
```

<Callout type="warning">
Homebrew installations **cannot** use `pilot upgrade` or hot-upgrade. Homebrew manages the binary location, so self-update is blocked. Use `brew upgrade pilot` instead. If you want Pilot's built-in upgrade flow, use the curl install above.
</Callout>

## Alternative: From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alekspetrov/pilot.git
cd pilot
make build
# Binary at ./bin/pilot — copy to your PATH
cp ./bin/pilot ~/.local/bin/pilot
```

## Verify Installation

```bash
pilot --version
# pilot version v0.23.3
```

Run the health check to verify all dependencies:

```bash
pilot doctor
```

`pilot doctor` checks for:
- **Claude Code** — CLI installed and accessible
- **Git** — version control available
- **gh** (optional) — GitHub CLI for PR management
- **Configuration** — config file exists and is valid
- **Tokens** — required environment variables are set

<Callout type="info">
If `pilot doctor` reports issues, see [Troubleshooting](/guides/troubleshooting) for common fixes.
