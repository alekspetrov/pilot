# Pilot

**AI that ships your tickets** - powered by Navigator.

## What is Pilot?

Pilot is an autonomous AI development pipeline that:
- Receives tickets from GitHub Issues (Linear/Jira coming soon)
- Plans and executes implementation using Claude Code + Navigator
- Creates PRs with full context
- Learns patterns across projects

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alekspetrov/pilot/main/install.sh | bash

# Start with Telegram + GitHub
pilot start --telegram --github
```

## Why Navigator?

Pilot's secret weapon is **Navigator integration**. Without Navigator, Pilot would be just another Claude Code wrapper.
