# Deployment Overview

Pilot is a single Go binary with minimal runtime dependencies. This section covers deployment options from local development to production cloud environments.

## Requirements

To run Pilot, you need:

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Pilot binary** | Single Go binary, no runtime dependencies |
| **Git** | Installed and configured with credentials |
| **Claude Code CLI** | Or alternative backend (Qwen Code, OpenCode) — see [Execution Backends](/features/execution-backends) |
| **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY** | API key for Claude (or equivalent for your backend) |
| **GITHUB_TOKEN** | Or equivalent for your PM adapter (GitLab, Azure DevOps, Linear, Jira) |
| **Network access** | Outbound to GitHub/GitLab API + Anthropic API |

### Optional

mv pilot ~/.local/bin/

# Set environment variables
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_..."
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Run
pilot start --github
```
