**AI that ships your tickets while you focus on architecture.**

Pilot is an autonomous development pipeline with **240+ features** production-ready. It picks up tickets from GitHub Issues, GitLab Issues, Linear, Jira, Asana, Plane, or Discord — plans the implementation using your codebase context, writes code with Claude Code, runs quality gates, and opens a pull request. You review and merge.

No prompting. No babysitting. Label a ticket, get a PR or a release.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alekspetrov/pilot/main/install.sh | bash

# Configure
pilot setup

# Set your Git token (GitHub or GitLab)
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-token"   # or GITLAB_TOKEN

# Start Pilot
pilot start --github --dashboard   # or --gitlab
```

Then label any issue with `pilot`. Pilot picks it up within 30 seconds.

Works with your **Claude subscription** (Pro/Max) or Anthropic API key. No separate API key required if you're already logged into Claude Code.

## What Makes Pilot Different

### Ticket-driven, not prompt-driven

Other AI tools need you in the loop — typing prompts, reviewing suggestions, copy-pasting code. Pilot works from your existing ticket system. Write the ticket like you would for a junior developer. Pilot handles the rest.

### Context intelligence

Pilot's built-in context engine reduces token usage by 92% while following your architecture, patterns, and conventions. Strategic documentation loading gives Pilot deep codebase understanding — not generic code generation. [Learn more →](/navigator)

### Autopilot CI loop

Pilot doesn't stop at creating a PR. In autopilot mode, it monitors CI, auto-merges when tests pass, and automatically creates fix issues when CI fails — targeting the original branch for fast iteration. Three modes: `dev` (fast), `stage` (CI required), `prod` (human approval required).

### Self-hosted, self-updating

Single Go binary. Runs on your infrastructure. Your secrets never leave your environment. [Hot-upgrades](/features/hot-upgrade) itself without downtime — press `u` in the dashboard and the binary replaces itself in-place.

| **Multi-repo polling** | Manage multiple repositories from a single instance |
| **Session Resume** | 40% token savings on self-review via context continuation |
| **Model Routing** | Trivial tasks use fast models, complex tasks use deep reasoning |

## Who It's For

**Solo developers** — Handle your backlog of boring tickets while you build features. Wake up to PRs ready for review.

**Team leads** — Turn 47 tickets into 47 PRs. Review them like any team member's code. No new tool to learn — your team just labels issues.

**Organizations** — Codify engineering standards with context intelligence. Every PR follows your patterns, across every team. Self-hosted for security. PR review for control.

---

## Ideal Tasks

Pilot works best on well-defined, bounded work:

- CRUD endpoints and React components
- Test coverage for existing code
- Documentation and README updates
- Bug fixes with clear reproduction steps
- Dependency updates and security patches
- Database migrations with straightforward schema changes

Not for: architecture decisions, novel algorithms, or anything requiring engineering judgment. Pilot augments your team — it doesn't replace it.
