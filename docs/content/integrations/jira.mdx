# Jira Integration

Pilot connects to Jira Cloud and Jira Server to receive issues and post status updates. When an issue is labeled with the pilot tag, Pilot implements it and links the resulting PR back to the Jira issue.

<Callout type="info">
The Jira adapter supports webhook handling and API operations. For polling-based intake (like GitHub and GitLab), configure polling in `config.yaml`. Webhook mode requires a publicly accessible endpoint — see [Tunnel](/getting-started/configuration#tunnel) for local development.
</Callout>

## Setup

### 1. Create a Jira API Token

**Jira Cloud:**
1. Go to [id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
2. Click **Create API token**
3. Copy the token

**Jira Server:**
1. Go to **Profile** → **Personal Access Tokens**
2. Create a new token

### 2. Configure Pilot

```yaml
# ~/.pilot/config.yaml
jira:
  enabled: true
  platform: cloud            # "cloud" or "server"
  base_url: https://your-company.atlassian.net
  username: pilot@company.com
  api_token: ${JIRA_API_TOKEN}
  pilot_label: pilot
  transitions:
    in_progress: "21"        # Jira transition ID
    done: "31"               # Jira transition ID
```

<Callout type="info">
For Jira Cloud, `username` is your email address. For Jira Server, it's your login username.
</Callout>

## Configuration Reference

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | bool | `false` | Enable the Jira adapter |
| `platform` | string | `"cloud"` | `"cloud"` or `"server"` |
| `base_url` | string | required | Jira instance URL |
| `username` | string | required | Email (Cloud) or username (Server) |
| `api_token` | string | required | API token |
| `webhook_secret` | string | — | HMAC secret for webhook signature verification |
| `pilot_label` | string | `"pilot"` | Label that triggers Pilot |
| `transitions.in_progress` | string | — | Jira transition ID for "In Progress" |
| `transitions.done` | string | — | Jira transition ID for "Done" |

### Finding Transition IDs

Transition IDs vary by project and workflow. To find yours:

```bash
curl -u user@example.com:$JIRA_API_TOKEN \
  https://your-company.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/PROJ-1/transitions
```

If transition IDs are not configured, Pilot falls back to matching by status name ("In Progress", "Done").

## Webhooks

### Setting Up Jira Webhooks

1. Go to **Jira** → **Settings** → **System** → **Webhooks**
2. Create a new webhook pointing to `https://your-pilot.example.com/webhooks/jira`
3. Select events: **Issue created**, **Issue updated**

### Supported Events

| Event | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `jira:issue_created` | Process if issue has pilot label |
| `jira:issue_updated` | Process if pilot label was just added (changelog detection) |
| `comment_created` | Ignored |

### Webhook Security

Jira webhooks are verified using HMAC-SHA256 signatures via the `X-Hub-Signature` header. If `webhook_secret` is not set, all webhooks are accepted.

## API Differences: Cloud vs Server

| Aspect | Jira Cloud | Jira Server |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| API version | REST API v3 | REST API v2 |
| Auth | Basic (email:token) | Basic (username:token) |
| Description format | ADF (Atlassian Document Format) | Plain text / HTML |
| Comment format | ADF | Plain text |

Pilot automatically detects the platform from configuration and uses the correct API version and content format.

## Issue Type Mapping

### Priority Mapping

| Jira Priority | Value | Pilot Priority |
|--------------|-------|---------------|
| Highest / Blocker / Critical | 1 | Urgent |
| High / Major | 2 | High |
| Medium | 3 | Medium |
| Low / Minor | 4 | Low |
| Lowest / Trivial | 5 | Lowest |

### Task Conversion

Jira issues are converted to Pilot tasks with the following mapping:

| Jira Field | Pilot Field | Format |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Issue key | Task ID | `JIRA-{key}` (e.g., `JIRA-PROJ-42`) |
| Summary | Title | Direct |
| Description | Description | Cleaned text (ADF extracted for Cloud) |
| Priority | Priority | Mapped (see table above) |
| Labels | Labels | Filtered (excludes `pilot` and priority labels) |
| Project key | ProjectKey | Direct |

## Reliability Features (v2.10.0)

### ProcessedStore — Duplicate Prevention

The Jira poller tracks which issues have been processed using a persistent store backed by SQLite. This prevents duplicate task dispatch across restarts, hot upgrades, and crash recovery.

On startup the poller loads previously processed issue keys. After successful execution an issue is marked as processed; if execution fails, the mark is removed so the issue is retried on the next poll cycle.

No additional configuration is required — ProcessedStore is wired automatically when using the default Pilot setup.

### Autopilot Pipeline via OnPRCreated

Starting in v2.10.0, Jira-sourced tasks have full autopilot parity with GitHub issues. When Pilot creates a PR for a Jira issue, the `OnPRCreated` callback wires it into the autopilot controller, enabling:

- **CI monitoring** — Pilot watches the PR's CI status and posts updates back to the Jira issue
- **Auto-merge** — PRs that pass all quality gates are merged automatically (when enabled)
- **Feedback loop** — CI failures trigger automatic fix attempts

This brings Jira to the same level of automation previously available only for GitHub-sourced tasks.

## Status Transitions

Pilot updates Jira issue status as it works:

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Started | Transitions to "In Progress" (by ID or name fallback) |
| Completed | Transitions to "Done" + adds PR as remote link |
| Failed | Posts failure comment (no state change) |

### PR Linking

When Pilot creates a PR, it adds a **remote link** to the Jira issue pointing to the GitHub/GitLab PR URL, visible in the issue's "Links" section.
