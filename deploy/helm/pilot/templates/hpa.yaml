{{/*
HPA is intentionally disabled for Pilot.

Pilot uses SQLite for state storage, which does not support concurrent access
from multiple pods. Horizontal scaling would cause database file lock conflicts
and data corruption.

Scale Pilot vertically by increasing resources.requests/limits, not replicas.

This file exists as a placeholder to document the constraint and prevent
accidental auto-scaling configuration.
