Performance testing is required to validate that the new system handles our expected load of concurrent users.

any issues early. The deployment strategy should include feature flags to allow gradual rollout and quick
rollback if needed. Security review is mandatory before the feature goes live in production environments.

This is a comprehensive implementation that requires significant planning and coordination across multiple teams.
The feature spans multiple components and requires careful consideration of the existing architecture patterns.
We need to ensure backward compatibility while introducing the new functionality in a phased approach.
The project involves frontend, backend, database, and infrastructure changes that must be carefully orchestrated.
Each phase builds on the previous one and has its own set of deliverables and acceptance criteria to meet.

## Phase 1: Foundation
Set up the basic infrastructure and data models needed for the feature implementation.
This includes database migrations for new tables and columns, API scaffolding with proper versioning,
and initial frontend components with placeholder data. We also need to configure the CI/CD pipeline
to support the new deployment requirements and set up monitoring dashboards for the new services.
The foundation must be rock-solid as everything else builds on top of it going forward.

## Phase 2: Core Implementation
Build out the main business logic and user-facing features with full functionality.
This is the bulk of the work and requires coordination across teams including frontend, backend, and QA.
We need to implement the core algorithms, integrate with external services, handle edge cases,
and ensure the system performs well under expected load. Documentation should be written in parallel.
Performance benchmarks need to be established early to catch regressions during development cycles.

## Phase 3: Polish and Testing
Add comprehensive tests including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
Fix edge cases discovered during testing and polish the user experience based on feedback.
This phase ensures production readiness and documentation completeness before the final release.
We need to conduct load testing, security review, and accessibility audit before going live.

The implementation should follow our established patterns and coding standards for consistency.
We need to coordinate with the design team for the UI components and the platform team for infrastructure.
Performance testing will be critical given the expected load on this feature during peak hours.
We should also plan for graceful degradation and proper error handling throughout the system.
Regular sync meetings with stakeholders will be necessary to ensure alignment on priorities and timeline.
- [ ] Foundation setup complete
- [ ] Core implementation done
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Security review passed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met`},
