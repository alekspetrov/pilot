# GH-1027

**Created:** 2026-02-13

## Problem

Bootstrap the three dead-code components. `ProfileManager` and `DriftDetector` get created inside `NewRunnerWithConfig()` (after retrier, line 374). `KnowledgeStore` requires `*sql.DB` so it gets wired at the two `main.go` runner creation sites (~line 1236 start command, ~line 460 gateway) where `store.DB()` is already available — same pattern as `autopilot.NewStateStore`.

## Acceptance Criteria
