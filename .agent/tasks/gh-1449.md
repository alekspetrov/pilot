# GH-1449

**Created:** 2026-02-17

## Problem

GitHub Issue #1449: Subtask 1

Parent: GH-123

First subtask

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Verify GlobalPatternStore deadlock fix is working
- [x] Confirm all tests pass
- [x] Validate build completes successfully

## Solution

Validated that the parent issue GH-123 (GlobalPatternStore deadlock) has been successfully resolved:

1. **Deadlock Fix Confirmed**: The problematic `save()` method has been replaced with `saveUnlocked()` that doesn't acquire additional locks
2. **All Tests Passing**: 96 tests pass in the memory package, including comprehensive GlobalPatternStore tests
3. **Build Success**: Project builds without errors
4. **Implementation Details**:
   - `Add()` method calls `saveUnlocked()` while holding write lock (line 117)
   - `IncrementUse()` method calls `saveUnlocked()` while holding write lock (line 175)
   - `Remove()` method calls `saveUnlocked()` while holding write lock (line 187)
   - `saveUnlocked()` method handles persistence without acquiring locks (line 83)

The GlobalPatternStore is now fully functional and thread-safe.
