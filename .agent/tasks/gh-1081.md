# GH-1081

**Created:** 2026-02-13

## Problem

Add the `brief_history` table migration, plus `RecordBriefSent()` and `GetLastBriefSent()` methods on `Store`. Table-driven tests for empty table (nil return), single insert, multiple inserts (returns most recent). This is the foundation with zero external dependencies — can be built and tested in isolation.

## Acceptance Criteria
