# GH-1114

**Created:** 2026-02-14

## Problem

Run the full build and static analysis pipeline to catch any compilation errors, lint violations, or code hygiene issues before deeper testing:
- `make build` — produces clean `bin/pilot` binary
- `make lint` — golangci-lint passes with zero issues
- `go vet ./...` — no suspicious constructs
- `make fmt` — confirm no formatting drift (check `git diff` is empty after)
- `make check-secrets` — no realistic secret patterns in test files
- `make check-integration` — no orphan commands, no missing build tags, config consistency OK
**Verification:** All six commands exit 0 with no warnings. Any failure here blocks all subsequent subtasks — create a fix issue with `pilot` label and wait for merge before retrying.
