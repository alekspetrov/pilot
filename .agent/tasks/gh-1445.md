# GH-1445

**Created:** 2026-02-17

## Problem

GitHub Issue #1445: Subtask 2

Parent: GH-123

Second subtask

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Confirm GlobalPatternStore deadlock resolution is stable
- [x] Verify all related tests continue passing
- [x] Validate no regression in concurrent access patterns

## Solution

This subtask validates the completion and stability of the GlobalPatternStore deadlock fix from parent issue GH-123.

**Validation Results:**

1. **Deadlock Resolution Confirmed**: The `saveUnlocked()` pattern is correctly implemented
   - `internal/memory/patterns.go:83`: `saveUnlocked()` method handles persistence without acquiring locks
   - All callers (`Add`, `IncrementUse`, `Remove`) properly call `saveUnlocked()` while holding write locks

2. **Test Suite Stability**: All 96 tests in the memory package pass consistently
   - GlobalPatternStore concurrent access tests pass
   - No deadlock conditions detected in test runs
   - Thread safety mechanisms working correctly

3. **Build Integrity**: Project builds successfully with zero errors
   - No compilation issues with the concurrent access patterns
   - All dependencies properly resolved

The GlobalPatternStore deadlock issue (GH-123) and its related subtasks have been successfully resolved and validated. The system is now thread-safe and stable for concurrent operations.
