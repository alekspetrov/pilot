# GH-1126

**Created:** 2026-02-14

## Problem

true`, enforce that its critical fields are populated: GitHub needs `token`, Slack needs `bot_token`, Telegram needs `bot_token` + `chat_id`, Linear needs `api_key` + `team_id` (or non-empty `workspaces` slice). Add log-level warnings (not errors) for Slack `bot_token` not starting with `xoxb-` and for empty GitHub `token` when enabled.

## Acceptance Criteria
