# GH-1432

**Created:** 2026-02-17

## Problem

if true, dispatch to the adapter-specific creator; otherwise fall back to existing `gh` CLI logic. Update `CreatedIssue` to support non-numeric issue IDs (Linear uses identifiers like `APP-123`). Update `ExecuteSubIssues()` to use adapter-aware issue operations (comment/close via `SubIssueCreator` or fall back to `gh`). Add tests for the dispatch logic.

## Acceptance Criteria
