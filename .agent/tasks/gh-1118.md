# GH-1118

**Created:** 2026-02-14
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Problem

Create the distribution packages and validate they work on target platforms:
- `make package VERSION=v1.0.0` — creates tarballs for all platforms (darwin-amd64, darwin-arm64, linux-amd64, linux-arm64)
- Verify checksums file is generated and matches archives
- Extract and run the macOS arm64 binary — confirm `pilot version` outputs `v1.0.0`
- If Linux amd64 is available (CI or Docker): extract and run that binary too
- Validate archive contents: binary exists, has correct permissions, no extraneous files
- Final sign-off: confirm no known blockers remain, document any issues found, declare readiness for version bump issue
**Verification:** All tarballs created, checksums valid, at least one platform binary runs and reports correct version. If any check across subtasks 1–5 failed and was fixed, re-run the failed subtask's checks to confirm the fix. Once all green — ready to proceed to the version bump issue.

## Verification Results

### 1. Package Creation ✅
```
make package VERSION=v1.0.0
```
All 4 platform binaries built and packaged:
- `pilot-darwin-amd64.tar.gz` (14M)
- `pilot-darwin-arm64.tar.gz` (14M)
- `pilot-linux-amd64.tar.gz` (14M)
- `pilot-linux-arm64.tar.gz` (13M)

### 2. Checksums Verification ✅
```
shasum -a 256 -c bin/checksums.txt
bin/pilot-darwin-amd64.tar.gz: OK
bin/pilot-darwin-arm64.tar.gz: OK
bin/pilot-linux-amd64.tar.gz: OK
bin/pilot-linux-arm64.tar.gz: OK
```

### 3. Binary Execution Tests ✅

**macOS arm64:**
```
$ /tmp/pilot-test-extract/pilot version
Pilot v1.0.0
Built: 2026-02-13T23:29:29Z
```

**macOS amd64:**
```
$ /tmp/pilot-test-amd64/pilot version
Pilot v1.0.0
Built: 2026-02-13T23:29:29Z
```

Linux binaries validated as correct ELF format (cannot run natively on macOS).

### 4. Archive Contents Validation ✅
All archives contain exactly one file: `pilot` binary with correct permissions (`-rwxr-xr-x`).
- No macOS `._*` resource forks
- No extraneous files
- Correct file types confirmed via `file` command

### 5. Binary Type Verification ✅
```
bin/pilot-darwin-amd64: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
bin/pilot-darwin-arm64: Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64
bin/pilot-linux-amd64:  ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64
bin/pilot-linux-arm64:  ELF 64-bit LSB executable, ARM aarch64
```

## Final Sign-Off

**Issues Found:** None
**Blockers:** None
**Status:** ✅ READY FOR VERSION BUMP

All v1.0.0 distribution packages created and validated successfully. Ready to proceed to the version bump issue.
