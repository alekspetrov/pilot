# GH-1083

**Created:** 2026-02-13

## Problem

Table-driven tests: missed brief (>1 interval ago → catch-up fires), current brief (within interval → no catch-up), nil store (no panic, graceful skip), never-sent (empty table → catch-up fires), and recording verification (RunNow writes to `brief_history`). Uses existing `setupSchedulerTestStore` helper pattern.

## Acceptance Criteria
