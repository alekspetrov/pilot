# GH-1082

**Created:** 2026-02-13

## Problem

Extend the `Scheduler` struct with a `store *memory.Store` field. Update `NewScheduler` signature to accept `store` (nullable for graceful degradation). Add `maybeCatchUp(ctx)` method that checks last-sent time against cron schedule and fires `runBrief` if a brief was missed. Call it from `Start()` after cron starts. Modify `runBriefWithResults()` to call `RecordBriefSent()` after delivery. Includes info-level logging for both catch-up and no-catch-up paths.

## Acceptance Criteria
